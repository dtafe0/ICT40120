# Exercise 1:
# Write a program to calculate salary. Take input for employee name, rate and weekly hours.
# Then calculate tax using:
# if rate > 45 then the tax is 0.02
# if rate <= 45 then the tax is 0.01
# Output the results with the employeeâ€™s salary and the amount of tax they will pay.

employee_name = input("enter employee name: ")

elif float(employee_rate) <= 45:
    taxrate = 0.01
else:
    print("taxrate is unknown")

grosspay = payrate * hours
withtax = grosspay*taxrate

netpay = grosspay - withtax
